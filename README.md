## Theory Background

The single diode model is a widely used equivalent circuit model for solar cells, consisting of:

- A current source representing the photocurrent generated by light
- A diode representing the p-n junction
- Series resistance (Rs)
- Shunt resistance (Rsh)

The model equation is:

```
J = Jph - J0 * [exp((V + J*Rs)/(n*Vt)) - 1] - (V + J*Rs)/Rsh
```

Where:
- J is the current density
- Jph is the photocurrent density
- J0 is the saturation current density
- V is the voltage
- Rs is the series resistance
- Rsh is the shunt resistance
- n is the ideality factor
- Vt is the thermal voltage (k*T/q)
